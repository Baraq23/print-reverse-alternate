function RevConcatAlternate() receives two slices of int as arguments and returns a new slice with alternated values of each slice in reverse order.
- The input slices can have different lengths.
- The new slice should start with the elements from the largest slice first and when they became equal size slices, it should add an element of the first given slice.
- If the slices are of equal length, the new slice should start with an element of the first slice.
